## Project Overview

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the complexity of financial markets and the large number of factors influencing prices. This project leverages a deep learning approach with LSTM networks, designed to capture time-series trends, to predict the closing prices of stocks based on historical price data.

## Features
- *Data Preprocessing*: Cleans and prepares data for training and testing.
- *Model Training*: Trains an LSTM model on historical stock price data.
- *Prediction*: Provides predictions for future stock prices.
- *Streamlit App*: A web app built with Streamlit to allow users to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

## Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshraz27/Stock-price-predictor.git
   cd stock-price-predictor
   

2. *Install required dependencies*:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. *Download the dataset* (if required) or ensure the data is available in the data folder.

## Usage

1. *Training the Model*:
   Run the training script to preprocess the data and train the LSTM model.
   bash
   python train_model.py
   

2. *Running the Streamlit App*:
   Launch the app to interact with the model and visualize predictions.
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   

3. *Predicting Future Prices*:
   Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on new data by running:
   bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_stock_data.csv
   

## Model Architecture

The model is based on LSTM layers, which are effective for time-series data. The architecture includes:
- LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.
- Dense layers for generating final price predictions.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training can be any historical stock price dataset containing fields like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Popular sources include Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl. Ensure the dataset is cleaned and formatted appropriately before training.

## Results

The model's predictions show a general trend in stock price movements, though precise predictions are challenging due to market volatility. The accuracy and reliability of the model can be evaluated using metrics like RMSE or MAPE. Sample predictions can be visualized through the Streamlit app.

## Future Improvements

- *Data Augmentation*: Incorporate additional features such as news sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors.
- *Model Optimization*: Experiment with other model architectures like GRUs or Transformer-based models.
- *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Perform hyperparameter optimization to improve accuracy.
